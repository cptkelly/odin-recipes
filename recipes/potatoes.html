    <h2>Dish Description:</h2>
    <p>The creamy cheese sauce and tender potatoes in this classic French dish make a delicious flavor combination. Serve potatoes au gratin with a roast pork loin or beef tenderloin, alongside a green salad.</p>

    <h3>Ingridients List:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Potatoes</strong>: This recipe starts with thinly sliced Russet potatoes. You can substitute Yukon gold, if you like.</li>
        <li><strong>Onion</strong>: Slice one onion into rings to layer with the potatoes.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings</strong>: These creamy au gratin potatoes are simply seasoned with just salt and pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter and Flour</strong>: The cheese sauce starts with a roux made with butter and all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Milk</strong>: Make sure you slowly whisk in the milk to create the creamiest consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese</strong>: Because isn't everything better with shredded Cheddar?</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Assemble the casserole</strong> - Layer half of the potatoes in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Season. Layer onion slices over top, then top with remaining potatoes. Season again.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the sauce</strong> - Melt the butter in a saucepan. Gradually whisk in flour and salt and cook for about 1 minute. Gradually whisk in the milk. Cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture has thickened. Stir in the cheese.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the casserole</strong> - Pour the sauce over the potatoes. Cover the dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven until the potatoes are tender and the sauce is bubbling.</li>
